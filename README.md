<!-- In today's digital landscape, securing sensitive information during transmission is paramount. Encryption stands as a fundamental technique ensuring data confidentiality. -->
<p align="center">A chaos-based encryption and decryption web application</p>

## Features

- **Encryption:** Encrypt plain text with a selected key.
- **Decryption:** Decrypt ciphertext with the corresponding key.
- **Chaos-Based Algorithm:** Utilizes a chaos-based key generation algorithm using the Newton-Raphson iteration method.
- **Key Selection:** Choose from five different keys for encryption and decryption.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** Used for the encryption/decryption functionality.
- **HTML:** Provides the structure for the web application.
- **CSS:** Styles the HTML elements for an intuitive user interface.
- **Decimal.js:** Library for precise decimal arithmetic.
